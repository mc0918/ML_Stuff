# neuralNet.py

neuralNet.py uses tensorflow and keras to load the fashion_mnist dataset, a collection of grayscale images of clothing sorted into 10 categories.

The program trains to identify images of clothing based on their pixel values, then returns a probability of the image matching a specific category.

The model can also predict the class of a single image and compare it to the actual class to make sure the prediction was correct.
